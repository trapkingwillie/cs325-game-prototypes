<h2>Comrade Skeltl: Amnesiac Desperado</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Comrade Skeltl will do whatever it takes to break the spell placed upon him and visit his family again; he is given three attmepts to locate the 'critical piece' holding the spell together, lest the spell cause his amnesia to act up again, thereby keeping him in Prototypia forever.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Comrade Skeltl was unfortunately cursed to nonexistence, after crossing a mean-spirited witch; help him gather the critical components to reversing the spell!
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
This game utilizes indirect mouse input, deterministic gameplay (with random locations of critical components, and random spacing of components), an 'Adventure', 'Side-Scroller' genre, and a 'Storyteller' or 'Director' play style. 

</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should experience emotional attachment to Mr. Skeltl, due to the unfortunate circumstances surrounding his involvement in this game. Furthermore, players will feel a sense of excitement and suspense while attempting to ascertain the 'critical piece' of Mr. Skeltl, required to reverse the spell binding him to existence as a mere skeleton. Finally, upon reversing the spell, players will feel a sense of relief and accomplishment for finishing the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Gameplay within 'Comrade Skeltl: Amnesiac Desperado' is based upon the plight of Mr. Skeltl, who is seeking to regain status as a person, rather than a mere skeleton. Players direct Mr. Skeltl's movement with the mouse, and collect various components of a human - money, a brain, a heart, food, and a soul. Players are given three attmepts to locate the 'critical piece' of Mr. Skeltl, required to reverse the spell, and transform him back to a normal human. Players make contact with any of the human 'components' within the playable area, and go back to the 'Spell Machine' (the slot machine icon located at the beginning position of the game) to determine if the piece is correct (or not). Players must observe the riddle at the top of the playable area - given by the spell to aid those afflicted with remedying their situation when considering which piece to select - the dialogue displaying the number of chances remaining will disappear once the correct piece is found - simply bring it to the Spell Machine to break the spell. If the player does not decipher the riddle and locate the correct piece, the machine will allow the player to check another piece (through contact with the next piece within the playable area); however, the machine will prevent players from selecting the same piece twice. If the piece selected is correct, the machine allows the spell to be broken, and for Mr. Skeltl to become the human he was before (illustrated by the human icon placed next to the machine). Finally, players move Mr. Skeltl to the home depicted in the top left quadrant of the screen, in order to bring Mr. Skeltl home to his family. System dynamics involve indirect mouse input to move Mr. Skeltl, and physics to determine collisions (and, thereby ascertaining the piece that the user is testing). This game is protoyping the game mechanic of item collection, testing, immovable sprite objects, and indirect mouse input.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
As mentioned above, the core gameplay mechanic (and the goal of this prototype) is to test the actions of item collection, testing, immovable sprite objects, and indirect mouse input. 
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
This game features a unique play style (indirect mouse input utilized to collect objects), fantasy-style graphics, and a plot which allows players to interct with Mr. Skeltl directly, and affect his destiny (whether or not he escapes his existence as a skeleton, and is able to go home).
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
This game is set in the mythical land of Prototypia, where John Skeltl was sent, after crossing an evil witch on his way home from work. The witch cast a spell on John, transforming him into his namesake - a skeleton. The parameters of the spell are such that John is given three opportunities to locate the missing 'critical piece' to his humanity, return it to the 'Spell Machine', and determine whether the spell can be broken. If so, John becomes his prevoius human incarnation, and may finally return home after one (very long) day at work. If not, John is stuck as a skeleton for all eternity.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The story surrounding Mr. John Skeltl being transformed into a skeleton is rather perplexing - a witch seeking spare change on John's walk home from work was displeased when John revealed that he only carried credit cards, no cash. Enraged, she cast a spell on John, banishing him to the land of Prototypia and transforminghim into his namesake - a skeleton. He is given three chances to locate the 'critical piece' to his humanity, and reverse the spell through returning the piece to the 'spell machine', located within Prototypia. Mr. Skeltl only remembers three events at a time, then the spell causes amnesia - thus the three attmepts at locating the 'critical piece'. If he manages this task, he is transformed back into a human, and is allowed to return home to his family. If not, he is banished to the land of prototypia forever - therefore, Mr. Skeltl is a bit of a desperado - he will do absolutely anything to come home to his family.
