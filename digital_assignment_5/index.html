<h2>Mathematical Conservationism - Part Deux</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The concept behind 'Mathematical Conservationism - Part Deux' is to diffuse the bombs placed within the Amazon Rainforest by ecoterrorists, before the timer runs out (and the bombs explode) - thereby making the player a conservationist for the Amazon Rainforest.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
	The themes utilized for 'Mathematical Conservationism - Part Deux' are 'Snob' and 'Conservationism' - the ecoterrorists are portrayed as math snobs (through their use of math problems as clues to diffusing the bomb), and the player as a conservationist, due to their participation in saving the Amazon Rainforest from the bomb's disasterous effects.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
	'Mathematical Conservationism - Part Deux' utilizes direct button input (through mouse clicks), and is entirely deterministic - the player is given a random 'clue' to diffuse the bomb, but it is the player's mathematical skill that determines the results of the game. 'Mathematical Conservationism' is of the 'Achiever' play style, due to the player's achievement of conservation (if the game is completed correctly), and of the educational, puzzle-driven genre (due to the involvement of mathematical equations as clues). 

</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
	Players of 'Mathematical Conservationism - Part Deux' will feel a sense of excitement and suspense while attempting to diffuse the bomb before time runs out, and a sense of achievement and accomplishment once they solve the mathematical equation given by the ecoterrorists. Any frustration felt by players may be stymied through the inclusion of interactive characters utilized for assistance, and the random inclusion of a 'hint' within the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
		The core game mechanic of 'Mathematical Conservationism - Part Deux' includes players placed inside the rainforest, and bombs  placed at the foot of a tree, both primed to explode 120 seonds from the player's initial contact with them - the bombs cannot be removed until the player has made contact with (and diffused) them. Defusal of the first bomb (located at the left of the play area) is accomplished through the solving of a mathematical equation given by the ecoterrorists, corresponding to a letter in their manifesto attached to the bomb, which in turn will indicate the correct wire to cut to diffuse the bomb. Defusal for the second bomb (located to the right of the first device) is accomplished through the decryption of the manifesto message, encrypted through a Caesar Cipher. To determine which rotation level (ROT) utilized, the player must solve a second equation. Once deciphered, the message will dictate the tool to use to defuse the second bomb. All input is performed through three colored wirecutter buttons, which cut the wire color corresponding to the color of the button. Once the players make contact with the bombs (through clicking on them), they are given 120 seconds to solve the equation, decipher the message, and select the correct wire to cut through clicking the correct wirecutter button - for instance, a solution of x=1 would correspond to the letter 'g' in 'good boys do well', which indicates the green wire as the correct wire to cut (bear in mind, spaces do not count when counting letters). Similarly, the word 'go' encoded with ROT-2 would be 'iq'.  A message is displayed indicating success or failure; the timer only stops once the bomb is diffused. Finally, a randomly-occurring note was left by the terrorists - if found, it will provide valuable intelligence on the means of defusing either the first or second bomb. Note - the bombs must be located sequentially (clicked on in order) - click on the bombs from left to right. Players may consult the characters for help at any point before gameplay begins; the hint (if available) is only able to be consulted during gameplay (i.e., once the player has begun defusing the bombs).

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
	'Mathematical Conservationism - Part Deux' is prototyping the game mechanic of a button-driven, educational, puzzle-oriented genre and a means of creating a bomb-defusal interface. 
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
	Unique features of 'Mathematical Conservationism - Part Deux' include an intuitive bomb defusal interface, and mathematical problems of random difficulty, which must be performed under pressure, along with two message encoding schemes, corresponding to the correct wire to cut on bomb one, and the correct tool to utilize in the defusal of bomb 2.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
	'Mathematical Conservationism - Part Deux' is set in the Amazon Rainforest, where ecoterrorists have placed two dirty bombs, in order to illustrate the importance of a rainforest through its destruction. The aforementioned terrorists have a bent for mathematics and cryptography, and have included a manifesto and a clue for diffusing the first bomb with the bomb, itself. Similarly, another portion of the manifesto, encoded with a Caesar Cipher, is included to dictate the defusal method for the second bomb. The setting of 'Mathematical Conservationism' is unique due to its intertwining of mathematics, conservationism, and snobbery - as the terrorists are math snobs, and believe that no one (other than another ecoterrorist) could solve the equations required to diffuse the bomb. The character diffusing the bomb is EOD technician SGT. Jones, with 20 years of bomb diffusal experience; however, it is up to the player to assist him - he has never seen a bomb with solving an equation and deciphering a manifesto as a diffusal method before.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
	'Mathematical Conservationism - Part Deux' follows the ecoterrorist group EFH (Ecoterrorism for Humanity) and their exploits within the Amazon Rainforest (bomb placement), in an attempt to show the world the consequences of the perpetual destruction of the aforementioned rainforest by the human race. A mathematician and a Roman soldier (knowledgible on matters pertinent to solving equations and the Caesar Cipher, respectively) have discovered the bomb, and have called the local police force; EOD SGT Jones is tasked with diffusing the bomb. As mathematics snobs, the EFH have included a failsafe means of diffusing the bomb, in the case of second thoughts as to the merits of such an action by any member of the EFH - simply solve the equation, use the solution to select a letter in the manifesto, and cut the corresponding wire - for instance, a 'g' would correspond to cutting the green wire. Finally, the terrorists may have been a bit careless when leaving the forest - look for a note detailing a hint to bomb defusal within the gameplay area.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
	The target audience of 'Mathematical Conservationism' is anyone who enjoys educational, suspenseful puzzle games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
	Approximate play time for 'Mathematical Conservationism' is 120 seconds.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
	A strong grasp of algebra (and a tolerance of stress) are critical for success in 'Mathematical Conservationism'.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
	'Mathematical Conservationism - Part Deux' expands upon 'Mathematical Conservationism', located <a href="trapkingwillie.github.io/cs325-game-prototypes/digital_assignment_4">here</a>, and expands upon it. Within the gameplay mechanic polish, Part Deux includes a mechanic for interactive, helpful characters (a Roman soldier, and a mathematician), who may assist players in the means by which messages are encoded, and the means to solve mathematical equations. Furthermore, the mechanic is expanded through placement of another bomb in the forest, and three more tools (a robot arm, water, and a battery - in addition to the original wirecutters) - bringing the number of possible solutions to diffuse both bombs to 1024, allowing for many hours of gameplay. The robot arm is used for remotely cutting wires, the water to short out the bomb, and the battery to 'jump' current across leads, and defuse the bomb through destruction of it's circuitry. Additionally, a hint mechanism is included in Part Deux, which may (or, may not, as the case may be) randomly appear for a period of 0.5 seconds, giving useful information on the defusal of the bombs. Restrictions are placed upon the times at which players may consult the Roman soldier (for Caesar Cipher assistance, and before gameplay), the mathematician (for equation solving assistance, and before gameplay), and any notes left by the terrorists (for clues, if available, and during gameplay). Multiple 'hints' may appear, but hte player may only utilize one - choose wisely - some hints may include more information than others.Finally, with respect to technical polish, all artwork is in accordance with the 'cartoon' theme of the game, and all user interactions are crisp, satisfying, and provide an excellent technical experience to the player. 'Win' and 'Lose' splash screens (a forest sans bombs, and an explosion cartoon graphic, respectively) were implemented, along with a more appropriate 'bomb ticking' sound effect, and theme music on both 'win' and 'lose' splash screens.
