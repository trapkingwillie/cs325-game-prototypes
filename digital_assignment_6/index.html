<h2>Save Mr. Trump!</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The concept behind 'Save Mr. Trump!' is to answer American History trivia questions, in aims of enabling  Secret Service Agent Sterling Archer to stop the bombardment of Mr. Trump by snowflakes, Democratic Donkeys, CNN, 'alternative facts', and Russian propaganda.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
	The theme utilized within 'Save Mr. Trump!' is 'person who needs protection' - Mr. Trump obviously requires Secret Service protection from a constant flow of nuisances - CNN, the Democratic Party, 'snowflakes', 'alternative facts', and Russian intervention. He has attempted to flee Earth in hopes of escaping the aforementioned nuisances, but to no avail.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
	'Save Mr. Trump!' involves direct mouseinput, in the form of clickable buttons used to answer the trivia questions. This game is entirely deterministic, based upon players' knowledge of American History. Play Styles utilized in 'Save Mr. Trump!' are 'Achiever' or 'Performer', due to the use of trivia questions to dictate whether the items plaguing Mr. Trump will cease, or Mr. Trump will be 'stuck' dealing with these issues forever. Finally, 'Save Mr. Trump!' features a 'puzzle' or 'educational' play genre, due to the inclusion of the aforementioned trivia questions.

</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
	Players of 'Save Mr. Trump!' will feel a sense of excitement, accomplishment, and challenge while answering trivia questions, and upon successful completion of the game, will feel a sense of patriotism due to their saving of President Trump from the various annoyances facing him and his administration from day to day.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
		The core game mechanic of 'Save Mr. Trump!' has players adopting hte role of Secret service Agent Sterling Archer, attached to the Presidential Detail ensuring the security of President Donald J. Trump. Mr. Trump has become rather enraged at the constant onslaught of 'alternative facts', 'fake news', snowflakes, and apparent Russian favoritism, and has elected to leave Earth for the Moon, in an attmept to escape such annoyances for some much-needed vacations time. However, the Democrats and other 'Deep State' actors have found a means of annoying Mr. Trump - even on the Moon. These actors have dictated that if Mr. Trump (or, his Secret Service Agent) can successfully answer three (easy) American History questions, he will be free from harassment from then on. Can you do it?
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
	'Save Mr. Trump!' is utilized to prototype the mechanic for a trivia-driven game interface, featuring multiple sprites and an algorithm to allow for multiple random trivia questions to be presented before the game is completed.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
	Unique features of 'Save Mr. Trump!' include excellent artwork, comical political overtones pertaining to America's most recent President, and interesting trivia questions pertaining to American History.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
	'Save Mr. Trump!' is set on the bleak landscape of the Moon, due to Mr. Trump's affinity for seclusion and avoidance of all things believed to be controlled by the 'Deep State', and any possible surveillance by the previous Obama administration. He has fled the White House and his vacation home in Florida, along with his Secret Service detail, in hopes of having a bit of quiet, Trump-Time. However, the Deep State has located him, and has began pestering him with the very things he hated most about Earth. Their ultimatum - answer American History trivia questions correctly, and the onslaught will cease forever; fail - and you are forever doomed to be tormented.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
	The story surrounding 'Save Mr. Trump!' is a simple one - the Trump Administration has faced numerous difficulties over the past few months, and Mr. Trump desires a bit of vacation, away from wiretaps, fake news, snowflakes, and all Democrats. He has therefore fled Earth with his Secret Service detail, and was enjoying a nice tanning session, when the Deep State located him - and began pestering him with CNN broadcasts, the whining of snowflakes, Russian propaganda, and Kellyanne's 'Alternative Facts', among other things. Interspersed within these items was a message - answer three American History trivia questions correctly, and the onslaught will cease. Being a bit of a cheater, Trump has enlisted the aid of his Secret Service Agent (TV's Serling Archer) in answering questions he largely believes to be below him. Can you save President Trump?
