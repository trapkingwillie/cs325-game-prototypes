<h2>Underwater Reconnaissance - Part Deux</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The concept behind 'Underwater Reconnaissance - Part Deux' is for players to recover undersea treasure through the programming of an underwater robot, in either an 'easy' or 'hard' mode.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
	The theme utilized in 'Underwater Reconnaissance' is 'Bookworm' - the SONAR operator is required to be extremely well-versed on SONAR principles and practices, and has learned much since the previous iteration of 'Underwater Reconnaissance' - he can now update the positions of the robot (and other objects) on the screen.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
	Much like 'Underwater Reconnaissance', Part Deux employs direct button input to move the robot, and to actuate the robot arms, as well as obtain a positional update from the SONAR oeprator. The deterministic play style created through this means of input is enhanced through random placement of both the robot and the treasure (or other items, as the case may be in 'Hard' mode). Play styles for the PArt Deux of 'Underwater Reconnaissance' are 'Achiever' and 'Performer', as the player (in either mode) must utilize the controls and other objects within the 'magic circle' of the game to recover the treasure successfully. This game resides within the 'puzzle' or 'programming' genre, as one must solve the navigational 'puzzle' of the underwater environment through programming the robot to complete the game successfully.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
	Players of 'Underwater Reconnaissance - Part Deux' will feel a sense of accomplishment after completing the 'Easy' mode of the game, and a sense of excitement and exhiliration once they are able to move to the 'Hard' mode of the game. Suspense and dramatic tension are created through the random placement of the treasure and other critical objects, along with the limited amount of time, number of moves, and number of SONAR requests available. Finally, once the robot reaches and recovers the treasure, the player wil feel a sense of closure - they have completed the game successfully.

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
	The core gameplay mechnic of 'Underwater Reconaissance - Part Deux' is the use of an underwater robot to recover treasure, in the shortest possible time. Players may select one of two modes - 'Easy' or 'Hard', and the game adjusts accordingly. Within 'Easy' mode, the treasure is placed relatively close to the robot, and the robot's position is updated after every move (for visual confirmation of the robot's relative position, in addition to the SONAR updates). 'Easy' mode serves to familiarlze players with the game's core mechanic. When 'Hard' mode is selected, currents are introduced into the game (drifting the robot and objects around the gameplay area), the grid structure is altered to more properly reflect 3D space, and additional objects are introduced into the game to allow players to receive a 'bonus', serving to increase the game's limit on moves or SONAR requests, and decrease the player's overall completion time, yielding an advantage when played with friends. Additionally, movements to objects by currents or player action are only reflected on the grid when a SONAR request is made, further contributing to the difficulty of 'Hard' mode. Within both modes, the treasure (or other objects) only become visible with a SONAR update, and after a move is made (or 6 seconds have elapsed), they disappear. Therefore, players must remember the lcoation of the object they are 'hunting', and, if currents are present, anticipate the drifting of said object. Players compete to achieve the shortest time to completion, and are limited to 130 seconds per game. seven SONAR requests, and 25 total moves of the robot. Once the treasure is reached (players are within 30 units of the treasure), players may extend the robot's 'arms' to recover it; however, if they are not close enough, they run a high likelihood of snagging the arms on underwater debris, and crashing the robot, thereby losing the game.

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
	'Underwater Reconnaissance - Part Deux' aims to prototype the core game mechnic of allowing two modes within a game - 'Easy' (tutorial), and 'Hard', all while maintaining the original mechanic of recovering undersea treasure with a robot.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
	Unique features of 'Underwater Robot Reconnaissance - Part Deux' include dual modes of play, a polished UI, an upgraded game mechanic, unique artwork, an educational 'Easy' mode, and the ability for multiplayer action (through comparison of completion times).
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
	'Underwater Reconnaissance - Part Deux' is set in the Marianas Trench of the Pacific Ocean, where treasure has been located. The player may select from either an 'Easy' or 'Hard' mode for treasure recovery, and will be given seven SONAR requests, 25 moves of the robot, and all uses of the robot arm must be successful, else the arm will become tangled on the ocean floor, and crash the robot. Move and SONAR constraints stem from the battery of the robot being less than optimal.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
	As in 'Underwater Reconnaissance', John Ballard has located another treasure chest within the Marianas Trench in the Pacific Ocean, and believes it to contain the last portion of treasure left by the infamous pirate, Black Beard. CPT Ballard is asking for assistance in piloting the robot into the depths of the ocean to recover the treasure, and has provided two methods for reaching the treasure within the robot - 'Easy' and 'Hard'. Select the proper mode for your skill set, but be aware that regardless of mode, the original robot has a 130-second battery capable of seven SONAR requests and 25 moves. The arm attached to the robot is extremely fragile, so be sure to be within 30 units of an item before deploying it, else it will become tangled and crash teh robot. You are CPT Ballard's only hope - will you succeed?

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
	The target audience of 'Underwater Reconnaissance - Part Deux' is anyone who enjoys computer programming, treasure hunting, or puzzle games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
	Approximate play time for 'Underwater Reconnaissance - Part Deux' is two minutes and ten seconds.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
	'Underwater REconnaissance' will reward the strategies of mental calculation, spatial awareness, and rapid decision making.

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
	'Underwater Reconnaissance - Part Deux' draws heavily from the core mechanic of 'Underwater Reconnaissance', with the additions of increased polish (through sound and images), and an improved gameplay mechanic (through dual game modes). 'Easy' mode allows players to learn the pace of the game with a simplified mechanic and updates to the robot's position with every move. 'Hard' mode introduces currents, multiple objects, and a play structure more akin to treasure hunting on the floor of the Pacific Ocean. Players must strategize and determine the proper time to request a SONAR update, as position updates (both textual and visual) are only given when a request is made. The currents introduced in 'Hard' mode cause gameplay objects to shift with the movement of turbulent water.
