<h2>Eco-Avengers!</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The concept behind 'Mathematical Conservationism' is to diffuse the bomb placed within the Amazon Rainforest by ecoterrorists, before the timer runs out (and the bomb explodes) - thereby making the player a conservationist for the Amazon Rainforest.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
	The themes utilized for 'Mathematical Conservationism' are 'Snob' and 'Conservationism' - the ecoterrorists are portrayed as math snobs (through their use of math problems as clues to diffusing the bomb), and the player as a conservationist, due to their participation in saving the Amazon Rainforest from the bomb's disasterous effects.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
	'Mathematical Conservationism' utilizes direct button input (through mouse clicks), and is entirely deterministic - the player is given a random 'clue' to diffuse the bomb, but it is the player's mathematical skill that determines the results of the game. 'Mathematical Conservationism' is of the 'Achiever' play style, due to the player's achievement of conservation (if the game is completed correctly), and of the educational, puzzle-driven genre (due to the involvement of mathematical equations as clues). 

</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
	Players of 'Mathematical Conservationism' will feel a sense of excitement and suspense while attempting to diffuse the bomb before time runs out, and a sense of achievement and accomplishment once they solve the mathematical equation given by the ecoterrorists. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
		The core game mechanic of 'Mathematical Conservationism' includes players placed inside the rainforest, and a bomb is placed at the foot of a tree, primed to explode 60 seonds from the player's initial contact with it - the bomb cannot be removed until the player has made contact with (and diffused) it. Diffusal is accomplished through the solving of a mathematical equation given by the ecoterrorists, corresponding to a letter in their manifesto attached to the bomb, which in turn will indicate the correct wire to cut to diffuse the bomb. All input is performed through three colored wirecutter buttons, which cut the wire color corresponding to the color of the button. Once the players make contact with the bomb (through clicking on it), they are given 60 seconds to solve the equation, decipher the message, and select the correct wire to cut through clicking the correct wirecutter button - for instance, a solution of x=1 would correspond to the letter 'g' in 'good boys do well', which indicates the green wire as the correct wire to cut. Bear in mind, spaces do not count when counting letters. A message is displayed indicating success or failure; the timer only stops once the bomb is diffused.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
	'Mathematical Conservationism' is prototyping the game mechanic of a button-driven, educational, puzzle-oriented genre and a means of creating a bomb-diffusal interface. 
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
	Unique features of 'Mathematical Conservationism' include an intuitive bomb diffusal interface, and mathematical problems of random difficulty, which must be performed under pressure, along with the message encoding, corresponding to the correct wire to cut on the bomb.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
	'Mathematical Conservationism' is set in the Amazon Rainforest, where ecoterrorists have placed a dirty bomb, in order to illustrate the importance of a rainforest through its destruction. The aforementioned terrorists have a bent for mathematics, and have included a manifesto and a clue for diffusing the bomb with the bomb, itself. The setting of 'Mathematical Conservationism' is unique due to its intertwining of mathematics, conservationism, and snobbery - as the terrorists are math snobs, and believe that no one (other than another ecoterrorist) could solve the equations required to diffuse the bomb. The character diffusing the bomb is EOD technician SGT. Jones, with 20 years of bomb diffusal experience; however, it is up to the player to assist him - he has never seen a bomb with solving an equation and deciphering a manifesto as a diffusal method before.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
	'Mathematical Conservationism' follows the ecoterrorist group EFH (Ecoterrorism for Humanity) and their exploits within the Amazon Rainforest (bomb placement), in an attempt to show the world the consequences of the perpetual destruction of the aforementioned rainforest by the human race. Hikers have discovered the bomb, and have called the local police force; EOD SGT Jones is tasked with diffusing the bomb. As amthematics snobs, the EFH have included a failsafe means of diffusing the bomb, in the case of second thoughts as to the merits of such an action by any member of the EFH - simply solve the equation, use the solution to select a letter in the manifesto, and cut the corresponding wire - for instance, a 'g' would correspond to cutting the green wire.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
	The target audience of 'Mathematical Conservationism' is anyone who enjoys educational, suspenseful puzzle games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
	Approximate play time for 'Mathematical Conservationism' is 60 seconds.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
	A strong grasp of algebra (and a tolerance of stress) are critical for success in 'Mathematical Conservationism'.
