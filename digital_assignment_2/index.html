<h2>Police Revenge!</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The purpose of 'Police Revenge!' is to crash into the escaping criminal vehicle, and locate their deceased victims (stashed somewhere on the map), before time runs out.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
This game utilizes the Storymatic theme of 'revenge'.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
'Police Revenge' utilizes direct keyboard directional key input, random locations of both the escaping cirminal vehicle and each victim (skeleton), along with a random tweening (escaping) speed and direction for the criminal vehicle, the 'Competitor' play style, and the 'racing' and 'puzzle' game genres.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players of 'Police Revenge!' should feel a sense of excitement and exhiliration after catching the criminals, along with intellectual stimulation when attempting to locate the victims of the criminals. Once both tasks are completed, players should feel a sense of revenge against the perpetrators of such terrible actions.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Players of 'Police Revenge!' seek to ram their police car (controlled through the directional keyboard keys) into the escaping criminal vehicle, the driver of which has recently disposed of three bodies around the playable area. To begin 'Police Escape', players observe the getaway car fleeing, and drive to the police station at the lower right corner of the playable area, in order to gain access to their apprehension tools, along with a 'hint' as to what tool to use to apprehend the suspect. Only one tool will work, and players must properly utilize the 'hint' to select the proper tool, or be forced to revisit the police station to gain another chance to apprehend the suspect (if the player guesses incorrectly, all tools are disabled, and the only means of reactivation is visiting the police station). Once the suspect is apprehended, his victims will appear - but all tools must be put away before evidence may be collected. The tools available to OFC. Jones are spike strips (indicated by the spiky icon), handcuffs (indicated by the handcuff icon), and barricades (illustrated by the roadblock icon). It is now the duty of the player to locate and collect the remains, in order to prosecute this criminal. In order to collect evidence, players must click the magnifying glass icon, after driving past all three vicitms (possibly, multiple times - evidence collection is difficult!). Once completed, the player has allowed OFC. Jones to get revenge on Mr. Doe by prosecuting him, and allowing closure for all victims and the city of Arlington.
</li>
