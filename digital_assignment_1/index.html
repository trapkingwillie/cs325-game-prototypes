<h2>Digital Assignment 1</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The purpose of 'Space Escape' is to keep the astronaut within the playable region and avoiding asteroids for 25 seconds, while overcoming the gravitational pull of nearby extraterrestrial bodies.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
This game utilizes the Storymatic theme of 'asteroids heading towards earth'.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
'Space Escape' utilizes keyboard directional key input, random numbers of asteroids, random gravitational pull strengths, and a random time to avoid asteroids and stay on the playable area, along with a science-fiction genre and goal-oriented play style. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players of 'Space Escape' should feel excitement for avoiding asteroids and keeping the astronaut within the playable region, in order for him to be recovered by his fellow astronauts. Furthermore, the countdown timer fosters a sense of thrill and accomplishment once the game is completed.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Players of 'Space Escape' can maneuver Astronaut John around the playable area utilizing the 'up', 'down', 'left', and 'right' arrow keys, fighting the system dynamic of Arcade PHysics (gravity) attempting to move Astronaut John into an unrecoverable area of 'outer space', and incoming asteroids attempting to hit John. Players should avoid all asteroids and remain within the playable area until the countdown timer stops - the player's keyboard inputs will allow for John's survival.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
'Space Escape' is evaulating the prototype goal of determining the playability of avoiding asteroids and keeping an astronaut within an 800x600 window, overcoming gravitational forces (the core game mechanic).
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
'Space Escape' features random gravitational forces, random numbers of asteroids, and random time requirements to accomplish the game's core mechanic and goal - separating it from all other space-oriented, science-fiction games.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
'Space Escape' is set outside of earth's atmosphere, in an area with frequent asteroid activity (all of which are heading towards earth). John, the astronaut, must avoid all asteroids, and remain in his current position for a period of time allowing his fellow astronauts to pick hium up, and stop all incoming asteroids from impacting earth. The game world (and its occupants) are unique and interesting due to their combination of realistic (the astronaut) and cartoon-style abstract (the earth and asteroids) design.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The story for 'Space Escape' follows Astronaut John, who has been separated from his fellow astronauts, has observed multiple asteroids heading towards earth, and must be picked up to aid in the destruction of the asteroids before they impact earth's surface. The dramatic tension of the circumstance will interact with the gameplay tension through action and drama-oriented gameplay, multiple levels following AStronaut John's adventures, and cutscenes featuring Astronaut John's previous occupation as an airline pilot.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience and demographic for 'Space Escape' is anyone who enjoys science fiction games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
'Space Escape' takes approximately two minutes to complete.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players with strong hand-eye coordination and spatial cognition will be extremely successful within 'Space Escape'.
