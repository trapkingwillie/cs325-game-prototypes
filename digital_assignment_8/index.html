<h2>Jailbird Blues - Part Deux</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The concept behind 'Jailbird Blues' is for players to coordinate with one another, without communication, to escape their prison cell through the decoding of a secret message left by a maintenance worker, detailing the vulnerabilities of the cell.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
	The theme utilized within 'Jailbird Blues' is 'car accident' - the two players attempting to escape jail were wrongly convicted of a hit-and-run car accident, and are now serving 90 days in prison for their (supposed) transgressions.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
	'Jailbird Blues' involves direct mouse input to decode messages, through the clicking of particular facets of the room which are vulnerable to escape. This game is deterministic within the realm of each player, as the decoding of the message dictates the game's outcome. However, each player is dependent upon the other to decode the other message correctly, which introduces a facet of chance and randomness into the game. Play Styles include 'Achiever' and 'Performer', as players must decode a prison 'kite' (message) to determine the appropriate route out of the jail cell. This game resides within the genre of a 'puzzle' game, due to the integration of cryptic messages with each escape attempt.

</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
	Players of 'Jailbird Blues' will feel a sense of exhiliration and excitement when attempting to decode the individual messages left for both Player 1 and Player 2, along with a sense of tension as a third player (the game's AI) is alerting the prison guards to the escape attempt. Finally, players will feel a sense of accomplishment if their escape attempt is successful, and a sense of camaraderie with their fellow escapee.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
		The core game mechanic of 'Jailbird Blues' is the decoding of two cryptic prison messages by two players, in order to determine the vulnerable portions of their prison cell, and thereby facilitate an escape. A third player, played by the game's AI, will alert the prison guards to the escape attempt, and allow a set amount of time before the guards arrive and send both players to solitary confinement. Both players must decode their messages successfully for the escape attempt to work; if either player decodes incorrectly, both players' attempt is foiled, and both players receive 25 days in the 'hole' (solitary confinement).

		Possible options (and therefore, controls) for the game are the sink, the bars of the cell, the bed, the pillow, the toilet, and both the left and right shelves within the cell. Each control has a 'target' for clickable actions placed upon it.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
	'Jailbird Blues' has a prototype goal of integrating an AI into a game, and creating a puzzle-driven, deterministic game style with sprites integrated into the game's artwork.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
	Unique features of 'Jailbird Blues' include the blending of sprites with the game's artwork, the integration of realistic prison messages as the clues for escape, and the involvement of three players - two physical, and one (the snitch) played by the game's AI.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
	'Jailbird Blues' is based uponthe premise of two citizens 'in the wrong place, at the wrong time' - both witnessed a hit-and-run car accident, whereby the perpetrators left their cars and fled, and the innocent bystanders were arrested for this accident. Once wrongfully convicted, each bystander was placed in an adjacent prison cell for a term of 90 days. They are coordinating an escape attempt through the use of an 'inside man' - the janitor - who has provided both a clue for escape, and damaged each cell to facilitate an easy escape. This game is set in Alcatraz prison, in February 1949.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
	The story of 'Jailbird Blues' involves two innocent bystanders to a hit-and-run car accident, Jimmy and Billy, who were falsely imprisoned for the crime (as they were the only people around the crime scene when the police arrived). Jimmy was sentenced to 90 days in Alcatraz Prison, as was Billy, and each player was placed in an adjacent prison cell. Through immense coordination, Jimmy and Billy managed to convince the janitor to weaken each cell, and leave a clue as to how to escape for each prisoner. If Jimmy and Billy are able to escape at the same time, they have a reasonable probability of success. However, if one player decodes their message incorrectly, a sleeping cellmate will wake up to the escape attempt, and alert the guards (sending both players to solitary confinement). The guards perform rounds randomly, in 15-60 second intervals. All escape attempts must be completed in this timeframe.
	
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
	The target audience of 'Jailbird Blues' is anyone who enjoys puzzle games, or anyone who enjoys stressful tension while interacting with other players.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
	Approximate play time for 'Jailbird Blues' is determined by the game's AI, and ranges from 15-60 seconds.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
	A strong grasp of American History, and a tolerance for suspense is particularly useful within 'Save Mr. Trump!'.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
	'Jailbird Blues' borrows ideas from the game 'Mind Meld', as players must answer different cryptic messages with the same answer to successfully escape, and they must arrive at this answer without any sort of communication. The utilization or cryptic messages and a 'puzzle' game genre is similar to 'Mathematical Conservationism' and its sequel, along with 'Save Mr. Trump!' (including the use of buttons to perform actions, a timed event, and the use of messages), with significant modifications made to all mechanical elements. With respect to the physical prototype of 'Jailbird Blues', the physical representation of this game prototyped the cell's artwork, the types of messages utilized as clues for the escape attempt, and the notion of 'escaping' and 'snitching' players (thereby instantiating a conflict based upon opponents). From this prototype, I learned that the core mechanic of the game (i.e., solving a message to determine how to escape) was valid, and presented a fun, challenging obstacle. Suggestions for improvement (changes to the physical prototype) included the implementation of a second escaping player, and the notion that both players must solve their messages to create a successful escape scenario - all while competing against an AI, which dictates the times for guards to make rounds (and foil any escape attempt).
